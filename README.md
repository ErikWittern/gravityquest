## Run the development server:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:1234 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


## Build for deployment:

```npm run build```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
